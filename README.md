## MDISK

### Simple script to mount a disk with Linux

Specify the full disk path, and then optionally the new mounted directory name.  If the mounted directory name is not specified, then it will have the same name as the disk specified in the path.

```sh
$ ./mdisk <path to disk> [name of mounted directory]
```

If no new directory name is specified, then the existing disk name will be used.

### Example

```sh
$ ./mdisk /dev/sda1 sandisk_ssd # mount disk at /dev/sda1 to /mnt/sandisk_ssd
```

## CPACMAN

### Wrapper for Pacman that maintains a list of user installed packages

Run cpacman just like pacman.  It saves a list of user installed packages. Intended to be kept as a backup to make arch reinstallation easy.

```sh
$ ./cpacman [pacman stuff]
```

### Example

```sh
$ ./cpacman -S neovim

```
or 

```sh
$ ./cpacman -Syu
```

After installation, a list of user installed packages will be saved to `$HOME/.config/packages.`

## WATCHF

### Watch specified files for changes and then run a specific script on change

### Example

```sh
$ ./watchf "./*.go" debug_run
```

This command watches all `.go` files in the current directory, and then executes the `debug_run` script when any files are changed
